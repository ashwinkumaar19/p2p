Global : Dictionary of peers in network
Peer:
  - Attributes:
		 - Packet object
		 - Peer ID
		 - Neighbours - list of peer ids
		 - LocalDir
		 - Server port
		 - Client port
  - pre-initalised set of ips
  - start a peer
  - initiate ping req
	check if ping req came from the ip:
		if not:
			ping in certain time intervals
		else:
			dont ping
  - wait for pong
      if pong packet comes back:
		add it to list of peers in network  //only once
  		add it to the current peer's neighbour list
		stop pinging
  - send pong req	
		- create packet from the packet's source_address
		- send it to the corresponding peer 

QueryThread (clientThread)
	- make packet	
	- send it to neighbours (from neighbour list in Peer class)
	- wait for QueryHit to respond
		- if QueryHit packet comes:
			- establish tcp connection to the source_address in the packet
			- recieve file 
			- write into LocalDir (download)
	- initiate File Search thread
	
File Search - thread
	- recieve packet from QueryThread
	- check if file is present in that peer's local directory
			call QueryHitThread
	  else
	  		store the source address
			flag set to 1
	   		call QueryThread

QueryHitThread (serverThread)
	- make packet
	- if flag equal to 0
			retrieve destination address and send it to that peer
	  else
	  		send to all peers in the reverse order
	- get tcp connection from QueryThread
		send file in bytes/objects (encrypt if possible)

Main:
	- start a peer 
	- get details about the file that the peer wants
	- start QueryThread
